# Kannada Character Recognition

This project focuses on the recognition of Kannada characters using computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The primary goal is to build a system that can accurately identify and classify Kannada characters from images.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main components:

1. **Feature Extraction Models**: 
   - Utilized the **Crack Code Feature Descriptor** and **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG)** for effective feature extraction from character images.
   - The Crack Code feature descriptor is designed to capture the essential characteristics of Kannada characters, while HoG provides robust edge and gradient orientation information.

2. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Implemented and compared the performance of three different machine learning algorithms:
     - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classification technique effective for high-dimensional data.
     - **Decision Tree**: A simple yet interpretable model that makes decisions based on feature values.
     - **K-Means Clustering**: Used for unsupervised learning to group similar character images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the models consists of labeled images of Kannada characters. Ensure that the dataset is properly structured and accessible when running the project.
